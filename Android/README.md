This is a demo on Android device. 
Although the web interface of Chrome allows bluetooth devices to be detected, unfortunately due to restriction on WebView for Android, such process cannot possibly be achieved.
Therefore, a demo that suggests how a possible Android phone could possibly work is produced, with Android Studio being the tool for development.
A visually-impaired person could download the android apk through this link:

It is an accessible android device.
Future improvement may break free from the dependency on html language, and use native Android functions instead to detect nearby bluetooth device.
